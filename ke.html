<h2> History</h2>
<p> According to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas.[40] Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it.[40][41] According to the 17th-century Hindu mythology work Keralolpathi, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram 'The Land of Parasurama' in Hindu mythology).[42] Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached.
